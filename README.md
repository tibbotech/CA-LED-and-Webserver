# LED and Webserver

This program sets up a simple web page on the device, with a form which is used to control the LEDs of the device. The form can be used for turning on either of the two LEDs, and also for entering a complex sequence of LED flashes. After entering a complex sequence and submitting the form, the sequence can be played by pressing the button on the device itself.

The demo shows the following basics:

- Building an interactive web page with embedded Tibbo BASIC code
- Using web forms
- Controlling the LEDs
- Interacting with the hardware button - working with events
